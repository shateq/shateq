Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I think that i can use Java, Go and JavaScript.<br>
<!-- Programming in CSS is kinda cool though. -->
As well, I'm a real enthusiast of <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>, <a href="https://fabricmc.net/">FabricMC</a> and <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>.

<!-- GitHub is a code hosting platform. Why not to add more socialization? In contrast to gitlab it doesn't stop on statuses, descriptions and avatars. Public profile readme feels (in my opinion) like a step closer to twitter - maybe it's okay. I can't judge anything. -->
<!-- Nevermind, whatever - there will be something here! -->
